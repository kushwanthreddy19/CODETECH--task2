PROJECT : STUDENT GRADE TRACKER PROGRAMM IN JAVA

A Student Grade Tracker is a software application designed to help educators, students, and parents manage and track students' academic performance over time. This tool can range from a simple console application to a full-featured web or mobile app. Below is a description and a basic example of how you might implement a simple console-based Student Grade Tracker in Java.

Description
A Student Grade Tracker typically includes the following features:

User Input: It allows users to input student information, including names, IDs, and grades for various subjects or assignments.
Storage: It stores student information and their grades, either in memory (for simple applications) or in a database (for more complex applications).
Calculations: It calculates statistics such as average grade, highest grade, lowest grade, and grade point average (GPA).
Output: It displays individual student records, summaries, and reports based on the stored data.
User Interface: It provides a user-friendly interface for entering data and viewing results. This can be a command-line interface or a graphical user interface (GUI).
